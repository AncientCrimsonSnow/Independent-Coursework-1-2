## Project Title
Building Intelligent Game Agents with Unity and Deep Learning

## Project Description
This Unity project implements various intelligent game agents using Unity ML-Agents and deep learning techniques. The goal was to explore the practical applications of AI in game development by creating intelligent agents capable of solving tasks and interacting with their environment autonomously.

## Project Structure
### Implemented Agents
1. **TestAgent:** Simple test agent designed to replicate an input observation value.
2. **ToGoalSimple:** Agent navigating towards a target position.
3. **ToGoalSimpleCollisionAvoidance:** Agent navigating towards a target while avoiding collisions with other agents.
4. **MazeSolver:** Agent trained to solve a procedurally generated 2D maze.
5. **SpaceCountClustering:** AI designed to divide a 2D space into clusters for collision detection optimization.

### Methodology
- **Observations and Actions:** Each agent uses different observation techniques (e.g., Vector Sensor, Ray Perception Sensor).
- **Rewards:** Designed based on task completion, movement efficiency, and collision avoidance.
- **Training:** Agents trained using various reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO, SAC, and MA-POCA.
